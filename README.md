# TDD Kata: Sweet Shop Management System
## Overview
The Sweet Shop Management System is a full-stack application designed to manage sweets inventory, purchases etc.
This project demonstrates proficiency in backend API development, database management, 
frontend implementation, testing, and modern development workflows, including responsible AI usage.
Users can register, log in, browse sweets, purchase items,
and (for Admins) manage the sweets inventory like he can restock the sweet,delete the sweet,edit the sweet and add the new category sweet. 
The frontend is a responsive and user-friendly interface and front-end focuses more on it's working and less on styling.

### Tech Stack
- Spring Boot for backend 
- jdk-21
- Mysql for database
- React for front-end

### My AI Usage
- ChatGpt+gemini for backend: Generated the boilerplate code and took the help to correct the error.
- For implementing jwt copied the code from the previous project.
- For front-end used the gemini only.Give the question description and the controller code and asked it to generate the front-end code.
- Then to resolve the error took the help of gemini only.
- Copy pasted the log and asked the gemini to figure out the error and based on that made the changes in the backend and frontend both.
- AI helped a lot while development especially while figuring out what to do next.
